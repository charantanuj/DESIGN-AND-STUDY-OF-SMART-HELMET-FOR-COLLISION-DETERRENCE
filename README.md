# DESIGN-AND-STUDY-OF-SMART-HELMET-FOR-COLLISION-DETERRENCE
Smart helmet is a kind of shielding helmet sported to the rider that makes biking safer than it was previously. The primary goal of this smart helmet is to keep people safe. Advanced features such as alcohol detection, accident detection, and position monitoring are used to accomplish this. This not only makes a smart helmet, but also a smart bike feature. Helmets must be worn at all times. The touch sensor inside the helmet triggers the ignition, which cannot start without it. The helmet also features an ultrasonic sensor, which alerts the user when an object approaches too closely. If the user is inebriated, an alcohol sensor is activated, preventing ignition from starting. When the vibration sensor detects an accident, it shall transmit a communication by GSM to your given mobile number with their current location, which will be determined by the GPS module.
